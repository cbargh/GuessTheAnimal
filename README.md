# GuessTheAnimal
Simple game / code challenge, implemented as a WPF application. 

# Animal Characteristics
Each animal has (must have) a Name (eg. 'Lion') , a colour (eg. 'yellow') , a sound (eg. 'roar') and a feature (eg. 'mane'). 

# Decision making
Initially supplied with four animals - rather than the standard two - to allow slightly better evaluation of the application's decision making functionality. 

The application will only ask enough questions to uniquely establish which animal was chosen ie. if there is only one animal coloured turquoise then that one will be chosen as a response to the question 'Is it turquoise?'. 

# Adding further animals
This is possible via a dialog. No checking is done to prevent nonsense being entered. Limiting colours and sounds to fixed lists and only presenting these is a potential improvement.
